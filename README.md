# mrMayaTools

A Collection of tools for Maya

The majority of these tools are an auto-rigging or rigging focused. This was originally designed as a personal exercise and toolkit to help with my rigging tasks.
I wanted to build a system that was abstracted enough that artists could think in terms of body parts when setting up and flexible enough to support animators editing and customizing controls without lose of data.

## The code itself

They were originally designed to be functional and mirror maya's cmds in terms of style.
I'm currently bug fixing the library for stability issues as well as reformatting it to be more data structure oriented for easier creation of presets, rig management, and customization.
